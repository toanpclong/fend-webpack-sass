# Webbpack Express Example App

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

## project prerequisites

- Webserver - Node
- Web application framework for routing - Express
- Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
- External script - Service Worker

## Get Up and Running

`cd` into your new folder and run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build-prod` or `npm run build-dev`
- `npm start` to start the app
-
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in server.js
